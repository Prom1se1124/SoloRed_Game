Change in HW2:
Revise the shuffle function so that it can work now.

Change in HW4:
Create an abstract model class implements RedGameModel. It implements the methods that Basic model and Advanced model share.
Let SoloRedGameModel and AdvancedSoloRedGameModel extends the abstract model. SoloRedGameModel only needs to override drawForHand().
